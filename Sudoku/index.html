      <h1>Sudoku</h1>

    </header>

    <div class="explanation">
      <p>For my software project I decided to expand on what I had learnt about 'wave function collapse' and javascript/P5.js during the 'Research Repository' assignment, and apply it in a new way.</p>
      <p>When reading into wave function collapse and how it worked, oftentimes it was compared to a sudoku, so ive decided to try it for myself</p>
    </div>


    <main>
      <p>Referesh the page to see a new sudoku generate</p>
      <p>It may loop a couple times before a final sudoku is generated</p>
      <script src="sketch.js"></script>
      <script src="cell.js"></script>
    </main>

    <div class="description">
      <p>Im pretty happy with how it turned out, I didnt expect to get so far into its development given the time constraints. You can see in a simplified version of how it works by pressing the "flowchart" button at the top of the page. Otherwise the full code is available on my Github at the top also</p>

      <p>Some things to be added in the future..</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A method of looking at neighbouring rows, columns and sections to check if a value choice will eventually trigger redo()</li>
        <li>Proper styling of grid. Including alternating shading of each section </li>
        <li>once a grid is made => save that grid => pick a random number of cells => add those cells to a list => for all cells in that list (value = '') => accept input from player and a 'check solution' button</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
